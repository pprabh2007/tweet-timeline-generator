Since the repository using GIT LFS (Large File System), it cannot be cloned directly.
Follow the following steps:
1. Go to https://git-lfs.github.com/ and download the version for your system.
2. In the directory in which you want to clone the project, use:

	git lfs install

3. You should see "git LFS inititialized". If you do not, it means your LFS is not properly set up.
4. Now, you can use git clone as normal.
